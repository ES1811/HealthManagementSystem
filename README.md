# Health Clinic

Project done entirely in Blazor web app. The idea was to create a mock-up clinic of sorts, with the basics such as appointment booking.


## Installation

Clone the project
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/ES1811/HealthManagementSystem.git
```
Then run ```dotnet restore```. This project requires the user to have a database (can be localhost), in this case I've used SQL Management Studio from Microsoft. User has to set up their own `appsettings.json`
## Roadmap

- Add Authorization & Authentication
- (Maybe) Customize the styling a bit more
- (Maybe) Add a working contact form
